    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. </p><p>A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat</strong>: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
        <li><strong>Onion</strong>: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
        <li><strong>Canned Tomatoes</strong>: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh Herbs</strong>: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
    </ul>
